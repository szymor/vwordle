# vwordle
Yet another wordle implementation by vamastah.
## how to play
Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word; feedback is given for each guess, in the form of colored tiles, indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position. The mechanics are nearly identical to the 1955 pen-and-paper game Jotto and the US television gameshow Lingo.
## hardware requirements
The game was created with retro handhelds in mind, so it should run properly on any device supporting 320x240 resolution.
