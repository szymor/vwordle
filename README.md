# vwordle
Yet another Wordle implementation by vamastah.
## how to play
Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word; feedback is given for each guess, in the form of colored tiles, indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position. The mechanics are nearly identical to the 1955 pen-and-paper game Jotto and the US television gameshow Lingo.

Tile types:
- green - a letter is in the word and in the correct spot,
- yellow - a letter is in the word but in the wrong spot,
- gray - a letter is not in the word in any spot.

## hardware requirements
The game was created with retro handhelds (Miyoo, RetroFW, OpenDingux, etc.) in mind, so it should run properly on any device supporting 320x240 resolution.
## about
The game has been created by vamastah. The original idea comes from Josh Wardle, a Welsh-born software engineer.
